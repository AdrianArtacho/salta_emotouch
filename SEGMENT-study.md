## Generate GIF

It would be helpful to have gif(s) on the first page, explaining what a 'choreomusical sequence' looks/sounds like (as well as how to operate the EmoTouch).

- Select video to be used for this urpose (not one of the used in the study)

- Select a few seconds, 10"max

- Anonymize video, fix audio

- Capture screen while using emoTouch

# PART1

## Perceptual Study

Welcome to this Ytansitions perceptual study on temporal segmentation, 
which means we attempt to identify the different sequences 
(segments, blocks, parts) that make up a specific dance or 
music performance.

Later we will go into a more detailed explanation of 
what those so-called segments can be, but basically
we will ask you to watch a short video (under 5 minutes)
while tapping on `button on screen` each time you feel
there is a moment of transition between two movement sequences.

### Agreement

The data generated in during this experiment will be 
used exclusively for research purposes. No personal 
information is recorded or stored anywhere.

`agree and continue`

# PART2

## Demographic information

This part is just made up to two questions about you. 
This information is only for statistical purposes.

`1. Could you tell us your age range?`

`2. What gender do you identify with?`

`submit demographic data and continue`

--- 

# PART3

## Tell us about your music/dance backgrounds...

From 1 ("no particular training or experience") 
to 7 ("I am a trained/professional musician"), 
how would you describe your competence in the discipline of music?

From 1 ("no particular training or experience") 
to 7 ("I am a trained/profesional dancer), 
how would you describe your competence in the discipline of dance?

`Submit answers and start study`

# PART4

## How to spot a sequence

Each sequence can be from very short (just a few seconds) 
to moderately long (under a minute) --depending on the piece--
so follow your intuition and click the `tap button` whenever
you feel there is a transition moment betwenn --what could be--
a sequence and the next.


# PART5

## Transitional moments


Sometimes a transitional moment is not 
stillness between two actions; it can also
be a more subtle inflexion within an ongoing action.
There are no wrong intuitions, so go with
whatever feels like a transitional moment to you.

If you feel you are ready to do the test,

# PART7

## Was it too fast?

Transitions might be hard to spot on the first try.
Now that you are familiar with the video,
would you mind doing it a second time to refine
your markings? Thank you!

## Demographic questions

- AGE

- GENDER

- COMPETENCE (likert scale?)

- Agree?

---

## Rechtseinräumung TN

Can that be done in one move together with the test

---

## Redundance tapping

Watch once the whole video (option to pass)

- explanation slide

Tap once

- happy with it? want a second chance?

Tap second time

- thank you

---

## ISSUES

- Store the videos in the channel from Atlas?

- Do I need a Live study, or a plyback one?

- Check the kind of data I receive (let it be the right one)

- Process, parse the incoming data

-
