## Generate GIF

It would be helpful to have gif(s) on the first page, explaining what a 'choreomusical sequence' looks/sounds like (as well as how to operate the EmoTouch).

- Select video to be used for this urpose (not one of the used in the study)

- Select a few seconds, 10"max

- Anonymize video, fix audio

- Capture screen while using emoTouch

# PART1

## Perceptual Study

Welcome to this perceptual study on temporal segmentation, 
which means we attempt to identify the different sequences 
(segments, blocks, parts) that make up a specific dance or 
music performance.
 
Later we will go into a more detailed explanation of 
what those so-called segments can be, but basically
we will ask you to watch a short video (under 5 minutes)
while tapping on `button on screen` each time you feel
there is a moment of transition between two movement sequences.

### Agreement

The data generated in during this experiment will be 
used exclusively for research purposes. No personal 
information is recorded or stored anywhere.

`agree and continue`

# PART2

## Demographic information

This part is just made up to two questions about you. 
This information is only for statistical purposes.


Each sequence can be from very short (just a few seconds) 
to moderately long (under a minute) --depending on the piece--
so follow your intuition and click the `tap button` whenever
you feel that a sequence ended.
```

## Demographic questions

- AGE

- GENDER

- COMPETENCE (likert scale?)

- Agree?

---

## Rechtseinräumung TN

Can that be done in one move together with the test

---

## Redundance tapping

Watch once the whole video (option to pass)

- explanation slide

Tap once

- happy with it? want a second chance?

Tap second time

- thank you

---

## ISSUES

- Explain better

- slide with the explanation

- Age continuum

- gif, example

- watch the videos twice?

- agreement small font
