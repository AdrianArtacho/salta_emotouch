## Public page (public_emoTouch)

The web interface with the information, the links and so forth is hosted
in a public repository
([`public_emoTouch`](https://bitbucket.org/AdrianArtacho/public_emotouch/src/master/README.md))
that is a submodule to the main one.

That repository can be placed in different pages:

## Blur videos

[Wassa Innovation Services - Computer Vision algorithms platform](https://services.wassa.io/subscription/blurit/trial/Adrian/success)

[WIS Manager](https://manager.services.wassa.io/task-manager)

- [x] Upload video to Wassa as a anonymization task

- [x] Download anonymized video

- [x] Normalize/substitute audio

- [x] Store away in the corresponding (RAW) GDrive folder

- [ ] Upload to youtube (for integration with EmoTouch)

- [ ] Embed in EmoTouch

---

## Example clips

It would be helpful to have looped video clips prior to the experiment,
explaining what a 'choreomusical sequence' looks/sounds
like (as well as how to operate the EmoTouch).

- [x] Select video to be used for this urpose (not one of the used in the study)

- [x] Trim a few seconds, 10"max

- [x] Anonymize video, fix audio

- [x] upload to emoTouch web

# PART1

## Perceptual Study

Welcome to this perceptual study on temporal segmentation, 
which means we attempt to identify the moments of transition
between the different segments
(sequences, phrases, parts) that make up a specific dance or
music performance.

Later we will show you some examples of
what those *moments of transition* might look like, but basically
we will ask you to watch a short video (1-3 minutes max.)
and tap on `button on screen` each time you feel
there might be a moment of transition.

### Agreement

The data generated in during this experiment will be 
used exclusively for research purposes. No personal 
information is recorded or stored anywhere.

`agree and continue`

# PART2

## Demographic information

This part is just made up to two questions about you. 
This information is only for statistical purposes.

`1. Could you tell us your age range?`

`2. What gender do you identify with?`

`submit demographic data and continue`

--- 

# PART3

## Tell us about your music/dance backgrounds...

From 1 ("no particular training or experience") 
to 7 ("I am a trained/professional musician"), 
how would you describe your competence in the discipline of music?

From 1 ("no particular training or experience") 
to 7 ("I am a trained/profesional dancer), 
how would you describe your competence in the discipline of dance?

`Submit answers and start study`

# PART4

## How to spot a sequence

Each sequence can be from very short (just a few seconds) 
to moderately long (under a minute) --depending on the piece--
so follow your intuition and click the `tap button` whenever
you feel there is a transition moment betwenn --what could be--
a sequence and the next.


# PART5

## Transitional moments


Sometimes a transitional moment is not 
stillness between two actions; it can also
be a more subtle inflexion within an ongoing action.
There are no wrong intuitions, so go with
whatever feels like a transitional moment to you.

If you feel you are ready to do the test,
click on the button below!


# PART7

## Was it too fast?

Transitions might be hard to spot on the first try.
Now that you are familiar with the video,
would you mind doing it a second time to refine
your markings? Thank you!

## Demographic questions

- AGE

- GENDER

- COMPETENCE (likert scale) in Muisc & Dance

- Agreement

---

## Rechtseinräumung TN (Study)

Can that be done in one move together with the test?
Yes, clicking on the `agree and continue` button
should be enough agreement on the participants'side.

Moreover, anybody can leave the satudy anytime.

## Parsing keys

youtube-normal-1

## Redundance tapping

Watch once the whole video (option to pass)

- explanation slide

Tap once

- happy with it? want a second chance?

Tap second time

- thank you

---

## ISSUES

- Check the kind of data I receive (let it be the right one)

- Process, parse the incoming data
