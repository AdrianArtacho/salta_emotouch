## Generate GIF

It would be helpful to have gif(s) on the first page, explaining what a 'choreomusical sequence' looks/sounds like (as well as how to operate the EmoTouch).

- Select video to be used for this urpose (not one of the used in the study)

- Select a few seconds, 10"max

- Anonymize video, fix audio

- Capture screen while using emoTouch

# Segmentation Study

Welcome to this temporal segmentation study, 
where the goal is to identify the different 
choreomusical sequences (movement + music) 
that make up the performance.


We ask you to watch a short video (under 5 minutes)
and tap on the `tap button` each time you identify 
a transition: the moment where a choreomusical sequence
(movement + music) ends, and the next one begins.

## Agreement

The data generated in during this experiment will be 
used exclusively for research purposes. No personal 
information is recorded or stored anywhere.

Each sequence can be from very short (jsut a few seconds) 
to moderately long (under a minute) --depending on the piece--
so follow your intuition and click the `tap button` whenever
you feel that a sequence ended.

## Demographic questions

- AGE

- GENDER

- COMPETENCE (likert scale?)

- Agree?

---

## Rechtseinräumung TN

Can that be done in one move together with the test

---

## Redundance tapping

Watch once the whole video (option to pass)

- explanation slide

Tap once

- happy with it? want a second chance?

Tap second time

- thank you

---

## ISSUES

- Explain better

- slide with the explanation

- Age continuum

- gif, example

- watch the videos twice?

- agreement small font
